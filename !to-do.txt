Finish QOTD:
  Create a column in the database for the most recent challenge that user has completed
  Create an in-memory object to hold ids of users who are currently completing the challenge and their starting time
  If user is currently completing the challenge and they reloaded the page or something:
    give them the screen with the problem
  Else:
    If user's most recent challenge id = today's date's challenge id,
      return a screen saying that user has already completed today's challenge, with a countdown until next day's challenge
    Else,
      1. record current time in an in-memory map or object
      2. send user the question
      3. wait for user to select an answer. when they do, record the time.
      4. get the difference between the times in step 3 and step 1
      5. if they're right, use a formula to give them their time-based score on a scale of 1 - 100
      6. if they're wrong, give them 0 points
      7. add this amount of points to their old amount of points and save in the database
      9. Remove them from the in-memory object
      8. edit their most recent challenge id
